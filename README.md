# TypeScript Starter

Simple TypeScript starter project

## Features

-   Write modern code with Webpack and Babel handling bundling, transpiling and minifying your assets
-   Have a pre-configured project with Prettier and ESLint to ensure best practices
-   Use TypeScript to improve tooling, linting, and documentation generation
-   Use Jest out-of-the-box for writing unit tests
-   Use Cypress out-of-the-bxo for writing E2E tests

## Your editor

Before you start developing consider downloading an editor [with good TypeScript support](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support) if you aren't already using one.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a very popular option and offers amazing support for TypeScript. This ensures good autocompletion, inline documentation and code refactoring features. Also I'd recommend installing editor extensions for Jest, Prettier and ESLint. These extensions will format your code, give live updates on errors and run tests automatically as you develop so you can focus on the features and let your set-up do the rest.
